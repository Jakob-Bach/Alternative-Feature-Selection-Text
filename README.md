> Bach, Jakob (2023): "Finding Optimal Diverse Feature Sets with Alternative Feature Selection"

is published on [*arXiv*](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.11607).
You can find its source code in the folder `paper_arxiv/`.
There are (as of May 2025) three published versions of this paper (use the tags of this repo if you want to obtain the LaTeX source code of a particular version).

> Bach, Jakob, and Klemens BÃ¶hm (2024): "Alternative feature selection with user control"

is published in the [*International Journal of Data Science and Analytics*](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41060-024-00527-8).
You can find its (camera-ready) source code in the folder `paper_journal/`.
It is slightly outdated since it bases on the first arXiv version.
Further, you cannot compile the paper without a `.cls` and a `.bst` file from the publisher *Springer Nature*, which we do not provide here due to copyright reasons.
