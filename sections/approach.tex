\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

FS survey \cite{li2017feature, chandrashekar2014survey, guyon2003introduction}
interpretability \cite{carvalho2019machine}
SMT \cite{barrett2018satisfiability}
wrapper \cite{kohavi1997wrappers}

can be combined with domain constraints \cite{groves2015toward}, group constraints \cite{yuan2006model}, cost constraints \cite{paclik2002feature}

focus on alternatives of sets as a whole - not 1-of-x for individual features (which requires user to define feature groups first, is similar to statistically equivalent signatures)
